This software is made for Windows 7/8/10
It's possible that your antivirus warn you that this is a virus or a trojan, just ignore it. It is, but, normally, you are using this software for testing and for your own.
I'm not responsible of any damage this can occur to your PC...Even if it don't do any damages.

# Uses and Copyright

Please, do not use this software without the conscent of it's original owner, me.

!! Please, keep in mind that the second you open the .exe file in the Dist directory, you will send data to me !! 
Everytime you press "Esc" you will send data, but also close the keylogger. I'm working on it to find a solution to restart the program after it was finished.

Feel free to suggest modifications or things to add.

This software is NOT open source.

# Data sent

The Data that will be sent to me are :
- The log file of the things you wrote.
